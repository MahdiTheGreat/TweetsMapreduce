The 2020 US election is happening on the 3rd November 2020 and the resulting impact to the world will no doubt be large, irrespective of which candidate is elected! After reading the two papers, here and here, I was inspired to attempt a similar sentiment analysis myself!
Content

Tweets collected, using the Twitter API statuses_lookup and snsscrape for keywords, with the original intention to try to update this dataset daily so that the timeframe will eventually cover 15.10.2020 and 04.11.2020. Added 06.11.2020 With the events of the election still ongoing as of the date that this comment was added, I've decided to keep updating the dataset with tweets until at least the end of the 6th Nov. Added 08.11.2020, just one more version pending to include tweets until at the end of the 8th Nov.

    Columns are as follows:

        created_at: Date and time of tweet creation
        tweet_id: Unique ID of the tweet
        tweet: Full tweet text
        likes: Number of likes
        retweet_count: Number of retweets
        source: Utility used to post tweet
        user_id: User ID of tweet creator
        user_name: Username of tweet creator
        user_screen_name: Screen name of tweet creator
        user_description: Description of self by tweet creator
        user_join_date: Join date of tweet creator

Inspiration

My primary interest for creating this dataset is to ascertain if there is a correlation between the sentiment of users on Twitter and the eventual election results. Other ideas that might be interesting to investigate include:

        Can we detect if there are or were any attempts at manipulating the election.
        Can we predict the candidate from tweet text only.
        Can we predict the election outcome of each state.

I also included still valid and interesting ideas from the Australian Election 2019 Tweets dataset below:

        Take into account retweets and favourites to weight overall sentiment analysis.
        Which parts of the world are interested (ie: tweet about) in the US elections, apart from the US?
        How do the users who tweet about this sort of thing tend to describe themselves?
        Is there a correlation between when the user joined Twitter and their political views (this assumes the sentiment analysis is already working well)?
        Predict gender from username/screen name and segment tweet count and sentiment by gender
